# hello-world
hello fellow living organisms.

i would like to tell all of you a bit about myself.
i am a teenager and hope to have some experience within fullstack development.
i am currently learning about javascript, along with the React library and Node.js.
i am also learning java, c/c++, python, sql, and c#
i am also learning about using game engines, such as Unreal, Source, CRYEngine, and Unity.
i have a huge disdain for people that say 'real men use c++' or any variant of that. pisses me off.
hope you have a good rest of your day!
